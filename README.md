# FasterLoading

### [Downloads](https://github.com/Shanghi/FasterLoading/releases)

## Purpose:
In TBC, loading speed is limited by framerate. This will disable vsync while loading then enable it back when finished. If you don't normally use vsync then this won't help you.

The more addons you use the more useful this becomes, but if you only use a few small addons the difference won't be noticeable. In my __extreme__ case with multiple huge addons that load a lot of data, the loading time goes from 18.5 to 3.5 seconds.
